Hi, I’m @meotod, AKA Lawrence S. Johnson AKA Larry Johnson. 
I am a former faculty of the School of the Museum of Fine arts, Boston, and a former member of Mobius Artists Group, also in Boston. Now I have no categories.
I’m interested in creating objects and events which encourage people to examine the workings of their minds. http://em-art-project.blogspot.com/
I’m currently learning immunology, Basque, French, Spanish, piano, number theory, photography, drawing, and other subjects I'm not remembering at the moment. 
I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but I'm open to ideas. 
How to reach me: lsj at meotod dot c*m. @lawrncsejohnson. http://meotod.com. http://lnaaguge.blogspot.com/
